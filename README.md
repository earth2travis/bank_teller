Make a system that emulates the transactions that are carried out by either a bank teller or an ATM machine. Utilize entry-level Python syntax, operands and concepts to implement the following five features:

1. Return the balance that the customer has in the bank
2. Allow the customer to make a deposit to their bank account
3. Allow the customer to make a withdrawal to their bank account
4. Allow the customer to decide whether to make the transaction with checking or savings account
5. Allow the customer to make a transfer between savings and checking account
